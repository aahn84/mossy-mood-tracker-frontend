# Mossy Mood Tracker
Mossy is Galvanize Seattle's Data Science Dog. She is known to be a little fickle, and this tracker is intended to allow users to report interactions with her. Each submission is stored in a backend database, and interactions are displayed to help the user understand the best time of day to play with Mossy.
